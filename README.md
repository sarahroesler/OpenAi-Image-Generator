# OpenAi-Image-Generator
Website using OpenAI to generate images.

This is a repo that uses OpenAI Api to generate images from a text prompt. 

It is avaiable by using Node and running on localhost.

You will need your own unique API key by signing up for an account at beta.openai.com. I've included an example .env file to plug in your key.
